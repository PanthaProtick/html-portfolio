<h3>
    
       1. 12 Angry Men:
</h3>
    <p>
        A 1957 movie about dissenting juror in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court. 
        This whole movie was recorded in just a chamber. But still manages to become one of peakest movie of all time telling about people of all ages and their emotions. 
    </p>
<h3>
       2. Stalker:
</h3>
    <p>
        Absolutely mind blowing movie by Andrei Tarkovski having marvelous choreography and camera cuts. 
        The story telling is very simple, however it gets way more complex than it seems. And the ending makes the whole movie plot wrong which is mindblowing.
    </p>

    3. The Blade Runner 1982:
</h3>
    <p>
